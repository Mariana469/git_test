Tell me about your professional accomplishments (some specific tasks or features) you are proud of?
Tell me about the task/ situation that was a real challenge/ tough stuff for you/ serious professional mistake over the past 6 months?
Tell me about a situation when you had to skip/ neglect minor rules while aiming to achieve your goal (faster).
Muse Lyrics
"Won't Stand Down"

I never believed that I would concede and let someone trample on me
You strung me along, I thought I was strong, but you were just gaslighting me
I've opened my eyes, and counted the lies, and now it is clearer to me
You are just a user, and an abuser, living vicariously
